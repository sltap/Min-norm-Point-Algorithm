This folder contains 3 files. File _Min_Norm_Point Algorithm_ explains basic matters including introduction to submodular function and lovasz extension. File _Associating Minimal Norm with Lovasz Extension_ proves that finding the point of minimal norm inside base polyhedron provides a solution to the minimization of a submodular function. File _Explaining Min-Norm-Point Algorithm_ explains the validity of minimum-norm point algorithm.  Definitions and letter symbols are passed bettween documents.

There seems to be slight differences between mechanisms of minimum-norm point algorithm stated in _Explaining Min-Norm-Point Algorithm_ and in matlab code https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20504-submodular-function-optimization?s_tid=srchtitle_submodular%20function%20optimization_1 (stated in the document), but it can be shown that both mechanisms work.
